                          that is a fluid buildup of the ear that hardens and binds with the cartilage in the ear making
                          a solid benign mass. It is common among MMA fighters and collegiate wrestlers. However It is
                          VERY uncommon for youth wrestlers since the rate and force of contact to their ears is very
                          low.</div>
